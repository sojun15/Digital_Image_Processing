## 1. Grayscale Image (Single Channel):

    In a grayscale image, each pixel contains a single intensity value between 0 and 255. This value determines how dark or light the pixel appears:

    0: Black (no intensity, completely dark).
    255: White (maximum intensity, completely bright).

## 2. RGB Color Image (Three Channels):

    In an RGB (Red, Green, Blue) image, each pixel is represented by three intensity values corresponding to the Red, Green, and Blue color channels.
    [0, 0, 0]: Black (no intensity in any channel).
    [255, 255, 255]: White (maximum intensity in all channels).
    [255, 0, 0]: Pure red (maximum red, no green or blue).
    [0, 255, 0]: Pure green (maximum green, no red or blue).
    [0, 0, 255]: Pure blue (maximum blue, no red or green).
